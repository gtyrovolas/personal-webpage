# My personal website

This is the repository for my personal website [gtyrovolas.com](gtyrovolas.com). On branch source you can browse Jekyll code and on branch master you can see the html for the website. This page is based on the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](http://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
