Hi, I'm Giannis and welcome to my personal website. I'm a third year Maths and Computer Science Undergraduate at the University of Oxford. My favourite courses until now have been Functional Programming, Topology and Machine Learning. 

I'm involved with student government and I am the current student co-chair in the Computer Science [JCCU](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/currentstudents/JCCU/).

Here you can find information on projects I've doing and notes from the courses I took.

When I'm not studying I enjoy reading, learning and playing story-driven videogames. My favourite movie in recent years is Parasite by Bong Joon-ho.
