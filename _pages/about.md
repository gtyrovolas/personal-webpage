Hi, I'm Giannis Tyrovolas and welcome to my personal website. I'm a third year Maths and Computer Science Undergraduate at University College Oxford. My favourite subjects until now have been Functional Programming, Topology and Machine Learning. 

Here you can find some information on projects I've doing and notes from some of the courses I took.

When I'm not studying I enjoy reading and playing story-driven videogames. My favourite movie in recent years was Parasite by Bong Joon-ho.
