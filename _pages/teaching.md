There are several great resources I've used to learn more about Mathematics and Computer Science.

- [The Napkin](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html) by Evan Chen. My favourite source for pure mathematics. Contains almost everything you might encounter in an undergraduate degree in maths, plus much more.

- [Algorithmic Puzzles](https://doc.lagout.org/science/0_Computer%20Science/2_Algorithms/Algorithmic%20Puzzles%20%5BLevitin%20%26%20Levitin%202011-10-14%5D.pdf) by Levitin and Levitin. A collection of 150 puzzles with hints and solutions. Used it for my undergraduate interviews for Computer Science.

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown/featured) by Grant Sanderson. A channel dedicated at explaining complicated mathematical concepts using visualisation techniques.

- [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://notendur.hi.is/mae46/Haskolinn/5.%20misseri%20-%20Haust%202018/Formleg%20ma%CC%81l%20og%20reiknanleiki/Introduction%20to%20the%20theory%20of%20computation_third%20edition%20-%20Michael%20Sipser.pdf) by Michael Sipser. Possibly the best book in theoretical Computer Science. The first chapters are quite accesible and later chapters introduce some of the most important, and interesting, aspects of computation.

- Christos Nikolaidis' [website](https://www.christosnikolaidis.com). My IB teacher's website for all your IB Maths needs.
